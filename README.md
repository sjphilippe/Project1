# Project1

This project analyzes data from the Los Angeles Metro Bike Share Program between October 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021. This is a public data source. I do not own this data.

Data Link: https://bikeshare.metro.net/
Tables:
-	metro_stations • Rows: 348 • Columns: 5
-	metro_trips 2021 Q4 (October-December) • Rows: 62647 • Columns: 15

I structured my analysis to view the data from 3 perspectives: user data, station data,  and bike data.  All data is based on the October - December 2021. 

### **User Analysis**

LA Metro Bike Share categorizes its riders via passes. There are four distinct pass types: <br/>
Walk -Ups: 1 ride access <br/>
One-day Pass: 24 hour access  
Monthly Pass: 30 day access<br/>
Annual Pass: 365 day access 

Between October – December of 2021, monthly riders dominated bike usage with a total of  30,993 riders, followed by  walkups, annual pass and one day passes. 
One day pass riders accounted for the greatest duration of bike usage with an average ride time of 75 min for one-way trips  and 112 minutes for round trips. 

A notable increase in riders was seen on October 10, 2021 which correlated with the CICLAVIA Heart of LA event. This event closed several miles of street in the center of LA to allow for prestration traffic on roadways. The jump in riders was most noticable in walkup passes and one day passes. Walkup passes increased by 344 rides(112% increase) and one day pass increased by 312(300% increase) compared to the previous day.
